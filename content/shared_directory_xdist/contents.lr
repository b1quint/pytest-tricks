# pytest-xdist

[pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) is a plugin for
distributed testing.

A somewhat common need is how one can make a plugin share data between
`master` and `worker` nodes?

# Shared directory

Here's a simple recipe that provides a `shared_directory` fixture which
points to a temporary directory accessible by both `masters` and `worker` nodes.

```python
import shutil
import tempdir


def pytest_configure(config):
    if is_master(config):
        config.shared_directory = tempdir.mktemp()


def pytest_unconfigure(config):
    if is_master(config):
        shutil.rmtree(config.shared_directory)


def pytest_configure_node(node):
    """xdist hook"""
    node.slaveinput['shared_dir'] = node.config.shared_directory


def is_master(config):
    """True if the code running the given pytest.config object is running in a xdist master
    node or not running xdist at all.
    """
    return not hasattr(config, 'slaveinput')


@pytest.fixture
def shared_directory(request):
    """Returns a unique and temporary directory which can be shared by
    master or worker nodes in xdist runs.
    """
    if is_master(request.config):
        return request.config.shared_directory
    else:
        return request.config.slaveinput['shared_dir']

```

Anything put in `node.slaveinput` dictionary during the `pytest_configure_node`
xdist hook can be accessed by the worker nodes later. You can put any
simple builtin type, like lists, strings, tuples, etc.

The `shared_directory` fixture can then be used by a plugin or even tests
to have a common directory where information can be exchanged. This
recipe also shows how one can find out if the code is running in the master
or a worker node.

tldr: Use `request.config.slaveinput` to send information from master to worker nodes in pytest-xdist
