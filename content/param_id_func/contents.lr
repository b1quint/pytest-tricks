# parameters for tests

**pytest** comes with a handful of powerful tools to generate parameters for a
test, so you can run various scenarios against the same test implementation.

- ``params`` on a ``@pytest.fixture``
- ``parametrize`` marker
- ``pytest_generate_tests`` hook with ``metafunc.parametrize``

All of the above have their individual strengths and weaknessses. In this post
I'd like to cover ids for tests and why I think it's a good idea to use them.

Please check out older posts on this blog to find out more about
parametrization in pytest, if you haven't already.

# test items

To understand how **pytest** generates ids for tests, we first need to know
what test items are.

For **pytest** a test item is a single test, defined by an underlying test
function along with the setup and teardown code for the fixtures it uses.
Essentially, everything we need to run a test. Suffice to say that this is a
slightly simplified explanation, but that's all we need to know for now.

Here's a code example for clarification:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'number, word', [
        (1, '1'),
        (3, 'fizz'),
        (5, 'buzz'),
        (8, '8'),
        (10, 'buzz'),
        (15, 'fizzbuzz'),
    ]
)
def test_fizzbuzz(number, word):
    assert fizzbuzz(number) == word
```

There is a single test function in above code example. It calls a function
called ``fizzbuzz`` with an integer and checks that its return value matches a
certain string.

Now when we run this, **pytest** creates a number of test items under the hood.

- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``1``, word: ``'1'``
- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``3``, word: ``'fizz'``
- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``5``, word: ``'buzz'``
- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``8``, word: ``'8'``
- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``10``, word: ``'buzz'``
- Item with function: ``test_fizzbuzz``, number: ``15``, word: ``'fizzbuzz'``

This is exactly what we can see in the test result log when running **pytest**
in normal mode (not quiet or verbose).

# what are ids?

Now **pytest** lets us add *ids* to test items to make them easier to
distinguish in the log, especially in verbose mode.

## auto-generated ids

If you leave it up to **pytest** to generate ids, you will see that most of
them are pretty good, but others feel somewhat random. The reason being that
*non-primitive* types such as ``dict``, ``list``, ``tuple`` or instances of
``classes`` are non trivial to translate into ids.

The following test is parametrized and the id for a test item will be a
representation for **each individual parameter** - joined with a ``-``.

```python
class CookiecutterTemplate:
    def __init__(self, name, url):
        self.name = name
        self.url = url

PYTEST_PLUGIN = CookiecutterTemplate(
    'pytest-plugin',
    'https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
)

@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'a, b',
    [
        (1, {'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}),
        (True, 'Into the Brambles'),
        ('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3]),
        (PYTEST_PLUGIN, 'plugin_template'),
    ]
)
def test_foobar(a, b):
    assert True
```

``$ pytest -v`` produces the following report:

```text
============================ test session starts =============================
collecting ... collected 4 items

test_ids.py::test_foobar[1-b0] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[True-Into the Brambles] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[Jason likes cookies-b2] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[a3-plugin_template] PASSED

========================== 4 passed in 0.03 seconds ==========================
```

As you can see whenever **pytest** encounters one of the *non-primitives* it
uses the parametrized argument name with a suffix instead.

For instance a tuple of str and list, such as:

``('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3])``

is translated to

``Jason likes cookies-b2``


## explicit ids

The good news is that you can define ids yourself rather than leaving it up
to **pytest** to somehow figure them out.

```python
PYTEST_PLUGIN = CookiecutterTemplate(
    'pytest-plugin',
    'https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
)


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'a, b',
    [
        (1, {'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}),
        (True, 'Into the Brambles'),
        ('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3]),
        (PYTEST_PLUGIN, 'plugin_template'),
    ], ids=[
        'int and dict',
        'bool and str',
        'str and list',
        'CookiecutterTemplate and str',
    ]
)
def test_foobar(a, b):
    assert True
```

```text
============================ test session starts =============================
collecting ... collected 4 items

test_ids.py::test_foobar[int and dict] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[bool and str] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[str and list] PASSED
test_ids.py::test_foobar[CookiecutterTemplate and str] PASSED

========================== 4 passed in 0.01 seconds ==========================
```

Note that passing a list of ``str`` values to the ``ids`` keyword overwrites
ids **per parameter combination in a marker** and **not for individual
parameters**. See how there is no ``-`` in the logged ids?

"Hey, you've talked about tests, items, ids, and now markers?!"

I know...it can be confusing. I hope to make this as clear as possible as we
go on. Hopefully in the end of this post, when reading the TL;DR, you know how
ids work and how you can use them to make your test suite more maintainable.


## markers

As I've mentioned earlier ``str`` id values are applied to a specific parameter
combination of markers rather than test items or individual parameters. To
illustrate this, let's have a look at the following code example.

```python
PYTEST_PLUGIN = CookiecutterTemplate(
    'pytest-plugin',
    'https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
)


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'a, b',
    [
        (1, {'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}),
        (True, 'Into the Brambles'),
        ('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3]),
        (PYTEST_PLUGIN, 'plugin_template'),
    ], ids=[
        'int and dict',
        'bool and str',
        'str and list',
        'CookiecutterTemplate and str',
    ]
)
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'c',
    [
        'hello world',
        123,
    ],
    ids=[
        'str',
        'int',
    ],
)
def test_foobar(a, b, c):
    assert True
```

Above is the same test from the previous section, but uses an additional test
parameter ``c``, which is set up with another ``parametrize`` marker.

So here's what you see when you would run this in ``--verbose`` mode:

```text
============================ test session starts =============================
collecting ... collected 8 items

test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[str-int and dict] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[str-bool and str] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[str-str and list] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[str-CookiecutterTemplate and str] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[int-int and dict] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[int-bool and str] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[int-str and list] PASSED
test_multiple_markers.py::test_foobar[int-CookiecutterTemplate and str] PASSED

========================== 8 passed in 0.01 seconds ==========================
```

As you can see here from the printed ids, for instance ``[int-bool and str]``,
a string value is taken from each marker and joined with ``-`` as it would for
the automatically generated ids.


## ids callables

Instead of providing ``str`` values for test items, you can also pass in a
function or method, that will be called for **every single parameter** and is
expected to return a ``str`` id. Unlike ``str`` ids the function is called for
every parameter!

If your callable returns ``None`` pytest falls back to the autogenerated id for
that particular parameter.

```python
PYTEST_PLUGIN = CookiecutterTemplate(
    'pytest-plugin',
    'https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
)


def id_func(param):
    if isinstance(param, CookiecutterTemplate):
        return 'template {.name}'.format(param)
    return repr(param)


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'a, b',
    [
        (1, {'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}),
        (True, 'Into the Brambles'),
        ('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3]),
        (PYTEST_PLUGIN, 'plugin_template'),
    ],
    ids=id_func,
)
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'c',
    [
        'hello world',
        123,
    ],
    ids=id_func,
)
def test_foobar(a, b, c):
    assert True


```

```text
============================ test session starts =============================
collecting ... collected 8 items

test_markers.py::test_foobar['hello world'-1-{'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar['hello world'-True-'Into the Brambles'] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar['hello world'-'Jason likes cookies'-[1, 2, 3]] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar['hello world'-template pytest-plugin-'plugin_template'] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar[123-1-{'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar[123-True-'Into the Brambles'] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar[123-'Jason likes cookies'-[1, 2, 3]] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_foobar[123-template pytest-plugin-'plugin_template'] PASSED

========================== 8 passed in 0.02 seconds ==========================
```

## id hook

A new hook called ``pytest_make_parametrize_id`` was added in pytest 3.0 that
makes it easy to centralize id generation. One of the reasons why you might
want to do this, is when you use instances of your custom classes for
parametrized tests. I personally don't think it's a good idea to change the
classes, by modifying the ``__repr__`` or ``__str__`` magic methods, just so
that you get this extra convenience in your tests. Instead I would encourage
you to try out this hook.

Let's have a look at how this hook works:

```python
PYTEST_PLUGIN = CookiecutterTemplate(
    'pytest-plugin',
    'https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
)


@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'a, b',
    [
        (1, {'Two Scoops of Django': '1.8'}),
        (True, 'Into the Brambles'),
        ('Jason likes cookies', [1, 2, 3]),
        (PYTEST_PLUGIN, 'plugin_template'),
    ],
)
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'c',
    [
        'hello world',
        123,
    ],
)
def test_foobar(a, b, c):
    assert True
```

The test and the markers are identical to the example from the previous
section, except for the ``ids`` keyword argument in the markers.

Now what we do instead is implementing the hook in a **conftest.py** file:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from templates import CookiecutterTemplate


def pytest_make_parametrize_id(config, val):
    if isinstance(val, CookiecutterTemplate):
        return 'template {.name}'.format(val)
    return repr(val)
```

``val`` is the value that will be passed into the test a particular parameter
and ``config`` is the test run config, so you could check for command-line
flags etc. if you want to.

We effectively moved the implementation of our ``id_func`` to this hook, which
means we don't need to set ``ids`` in all of the ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``
as long as we are happy with the way it generates ids. We can still overwrite
them by explictly by setting a ``str`` id or passing in a callable.

# fixtures

Ids for fixtures are in fact easier to understand as for ``parametrize``
markers, as they don't have any edge cases that you need to be aware of.
Fixtures always return a single value, which means regardless of whether you
use ``str`` ids, an id callable or the ``pytest_make_parametrize_id`` it will
always be applied to this very parameter that the fixture returns.

```python
@pytest.fixture(params=[
    CookiecutterTemplate(
        name='cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
        url='https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
    ),
    CookiecutterTemplate(
        name='cookiecutter-django',
        url='https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django',
    ),
], ids=[
    'cookiecutter-pytest-plugin',
    'cookiecutter-django'
])
def template(request):
    return request.param


@pytest.fixture(params=[
    'pydanny',
    'audreyr',
    'michaeljoseph',
])
def github_user(request):
    return request.param


def test_template(template, github_user):
    assert True
```

```text
============================ test session starts =============================
collecting ... collected 6 items

test_markers.py::test_template[cookiecutter-pytest-plugin-pydanny] PASSED
test_markers.py::test_template[cookiecutter-pytest-plugin-audreyr] PASSED

test_markers.py::test_template[cookiecutter-django-pydanny] PASSED

test_markers.py::test_template[cookiecutter-django-michaeljoseph] PASSED

========================== 6 passed in 0.04 seconds ==========================
```

# Conclusion

1. If you don't set ids, pytest will generate them for you

2. If you set them explicitly with ``str`` values

    a. they are set for a **parameter combination** in case of
    ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``

    b. or a value returned by ``@pytest.fixture``

3. If you use a callable

    a. it will be invoked for **each parameter** in case of
    ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``

    b. or a value returned by ``@pytest.fixture``

4. If you use the ``pytest_make_parametrize_id`` hook

    a. it will be invoked for **each parameter** in case of
    ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``

    b. or a value returned by ``@pytest.fixture``

So the only thing to keep in mind really is that ``str`` ids for
``pytest.mark.parametrize``.


Hope this helps!
